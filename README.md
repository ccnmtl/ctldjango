## How to use


### Generate the project
```bash
$ django-admin.py startproject \
  --template=https://github.com/ccnmtl/ctldjango/archive/master.zip \
  --name=Dockerfile,Makefile,package.json,stats.html \
  --extension=py,yml \
  project_name
```
Note: On MacOS, sometimes an SSL error will occur when attempting to download the master.zip in this way. To get around this, download a copy of the ctldjango master.zip to your desktop, then execute:
```bash
$ django-admin.py startproject \
  --template=~/Desktop/ctldjango-master.zip \
  --name=Dockerfile,Makefile,package.json,stats.html \
  --extension=py,yml \
  project_name
```

`project_name` should be a python module name (ie, lowercase,
no punctuation, etc). It will create a directory called
`project_name` that has a django project in it.

### Setup hidden files
* `mv travis.yml .travis.yml` to activate Travis CI integration
* `mv gitignore .gitignore` to configure git ignore
* `mv eslintrc.js .eslintrc.js` to configure eslint
* `mv bandit .bandit` to configure bandit security linting

### Misc
* Clear the README.md and add a bit about your project.
* Update the `Project Name` string in `base.html` with your application's display name.

### Check it in
* Check the project into version control now.

### Build
We use containment for django, with virtualenv:

    $ make

That will create a `ve` directory which contains a virtualenv and has
had all the libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file
installed into it (this includes django itself). The `ve` directory
should never be checked in. If you need
other libraries for your application, update `requirements.txt` then re-run `make`.

Keep in mind that with virtualenv, there's no need to `activate` an
environment. Instead, a ve has a `bin` directory which contains a
python executable. If you use that instead of the system python
executable, it uses the libraries in that virtualenv.

ctldjango assumes that your project will use a postgresql database
with the same name as your project. So, for our example, you would
then do:

    $ createdb myprojectname

and it is all set to use it:

    $ make migrate

will install the tables that django needs for it's common apps (sites,
sessions, admin, flatpages, etc).

Tests should pass out of the box:

    $ make test

They can be run via Jenkins as well and generate the right reports in
a `reports` directory (which you will want to gitignore).

    $ make jenkins

Your application is ready to run now:

    $ make runserver

will start a server on `http://localhost:8000/`. The admin app should
be accessible (via a user account created with
`manage.py createsuperuser`)
So go ahead and login to `http://localhost:8000/admin/`

Even without any application specific code, `flatpages` is included so
you can put content on the web right away.

From this point out, it's basic django development. You'll probably
want to do a `./manage.py startapp` to create your own application
within the project and so on.
